# MPC2000XL Digital Features Documentation

## Time-Stretching System

The time-stretching system implements the MPC2000XL's advanced audio processing capabilities with three quality presets and 18 algorithms.

### Quality Presets
- **Standard (A)**: Fast processing, suitable for real-time preview
  - Uses smaller FFT windows (2048 samples)
  - Optimized for minimal latency
  - Best for drum loops and percussive material

- **Better (B)**: Balanced quality and processing time
  - Medium FFT windows (4096 samples)
  - Improved phase coherence
  - Good for mixed content and melodic material

- **Highest (C)**: Maximum quality, longer processing time
  - Large FFT windows (8192 samples)
  - Best phase coherence and transient preservation
  - Ideal for final rendering and complex material

### Time-Stretch Algorithms
The system provides 18 preset algorithms across three categories:

1. **WSOLA-based (1-6)**
   - Waveform Similarity Overlap-Add
   - Best for percussive material
   - Maintains transient sharpness

2. **Phase Vocoder (7-12)**
   - Frequency-domain processing
   - Superior pitch preservation
   - Ideal for tonal material

3. **Hybrid Algorithms (13-18)**
   - Combines WSOLA and Phase Vocoder
   - Adaptive processing based on content
   - Best overall quality for mixed material

### Time-Stretch Parameters
- **Ratio Range**: 50% to 200%
  - 50%: Double speed
  - 200%: Half speed
  - Linear interpolation between extremes

## Swing Pattern System

The swing pattern system replicates the MPC2000XL's legendary timing feel.

### Swing Implementation
- **Percentage Range**: 50% to 75%
  - 50%: No swing (straight timing)
  - 75%: Maximum swing
  - Affects even-numbered beats

### Resolution Settings
- 1/4 Note (4)
- 1/8 Note (8)
- 1/16 Note (16)
- 1/32 Note (32)

### Timing Calculations
- Base grid determined by resolution
- Swing amount applied to even-numbered positions
- Maintains relative timing between events
- Global and per-sequence settings available

## Sound Bank System

The sound bank system includes classic drum machine samples and the original MPC2000XL factory sounds.

### Included Banks

   - Classic Roland TR-808 samples
   - Essential for hip-hop and electronic music
   - Samples:
     - Kick
     - Snare
     - Closed Hi-Hat
     - Open Hi-Hat

2. **TR-909**
   - Classic Roland TR-909 samples
   - Industry standard for dance music
   - Samples:
     - Kick
     - Snare
     - Closed Hi-Hat
     - Open Hi-Hat

3. **MPC2000XL Factory**

## Step Editor System

### Step Editor Features
- Pattern-based step sequencing
- 16-step grid visualization
- Note parameter control:
  * Note value (0-127)
  * Velocity (0-127)
  * Gate time (1-100%)
  * Duration (1-16 steps)
- Pattern management:
  * Multiple patterns per sequence
  * Pattern length (1-64 steps)
  * Resolution settings (4, 8, 16, 32 steps/beat)
- Real-time parameter editing
- Visual feedback for events

### Pattern Programming Workflow
1. Enter STEP EDIT mode
2. Select or create pattern
3. Set pattern length and resolution
4. Program steps:
   - Click step to add event
   - Set note parameters
   - Adjust gate and duration
   - Delete unwanted events
5. Manage patterns:
   - Add new patterns
   - Delete patterns
   - Copy patterns
   - Set pattern resolution

### Sequence Management
- Multiple patterns per sequence
- Pattern chaining
- Pattern switching
- Global tempo control
- Resolution per pattern
- Event timing preservation
- Bank organization
